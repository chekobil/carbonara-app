        through the golden brown crust into meaty bits of salty guanciale is
        part of the awesomeness that is carbonara!

          <strong>Sauce</strong> â€“ Whisk together the egg, cheese and pepper in
          a large bowl. It needs to be a large bowl because the pasta will be
          stirred into the sauce in the bowl, off the stove, to avoid scrambling
          the eggs.

          <strong>Watch</strong> as the watery pale yellow liquid magically
          transforms into a creamy sauce.

          <strong>You know itâ€™s ready</strong> when the sauce is no longer
          watery and pooled in the bottom of the bowl. Instead, it will be

        <p>
          <strong>Warm bowls?</strong> Yes. I donâ€™t usually warm bowls for
          serving food, but for pasta, I almost always do. This is because pasta
          is at its best when itâ€™s freshly made with the sauce is slick and the
          pasta is juicy. As it cools, the sauce thickens and the pasta gets
          stodgy. A warm bowl prolongs the life of pasta. I just warm bowls by
          placing a stack in the microwave for 1 minute. Else, run it under hot
          water or put in a low oven.
